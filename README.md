# Contact-Form-NewsLetter
This is a static "Subscribe To Our Newsletter" form or a "Contact Form" it depends on what you want to use it as. Feel free to change its styles, and post it because I want to see how creative you are.

Do whatever you like with it. Change its styles. Transform it into something else. Add some javascript to it to make it dynamic. Add a Firebase or a PHP file and make it submit to a real database. It's all up to you.
